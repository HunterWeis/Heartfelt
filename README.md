## What is Heartfelt
  
Heartfelt is a chrome extension that allows the user to highlight text and determine the positivity and friendliness of that text through sentiment analysis. This can help people reconsider what they type before sending it, so they get the best responses from others.

## How do I install it?

Clone the repository to a local directory and then go to the popup.js file.
Change the variable "apikey" to your apikey from https://www.havenondemand.com/.
Save the popup.js file and then go to Extensions in Google Chrome. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and 
navigate to the directory of the cloned repository and select it. 

## How do I use it?

Simply highlight any text and then click the extension. The sentiment of the highlighted text will be calculated!

## Bugs

If there is no response then:

1. Try refreshing the page.
2. Try reloading the extension.
3. Your wifi isn't working.
4. Havenondemand is down, and the call to the API server isn't working.
